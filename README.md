# PopularMovies

Here is an app that uses an ArrayAdapter to connect a gridview with JSON from a web service. It is loading the image URL from each movie object into a custom XML layout.
I also use picasso to handle the loading an placement! 

Here is the URL that I used to retrieve the JSON, you will need to vist The Movie Database and create an account to generate a custom API Key.
